# Model-Making-Discord-Bot
Bot made by me to create tickets and assist with discord functions.

Contains the Javascript and the Python version. Both of which were made while learning Javascript, Python, the Discord APIs, and the Google Sheets API.

Javascript Version:
  The more up to date and better looking one, has more discord features but lacks some spreadsheet support
 
Python Version:
  Made as a rough concept for what I wanted the bot to do, not modular. Has support to automatically build the Custom Class files and send the data to Spreadsheets
